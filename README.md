# hello-world

Hi all!

My name is Tyler Cristick and I am going through the Hello World GitHub project. I have experience in the past with programming in Java, C++, and various web languages (HTML, CSS). I'd like to get back to my roots and delve into an old passion. I believe this will be a great way to refresh my memory and learn a few things along the way!
